# Publish Plugin Packager

This skill keeps the legacy `clawhub-*` name for compatibility, but it now packages skills for multiple public ecosystems, not just ClawHub.

## When to use

- When converting an existing skill into a publishable plugin or bundle
- When generating or fixing manifests such as `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, or `openclaw.plugin.json`
- When creating the final runtime-only directory and zip structure for upload or distribution
- When producing a release artifact from an already-optimized source skill
- When shaping the package so it can compete better in public plugin directories

## When NOT to use

- When the deliverable is only a `SKILL.md` optimization; use `clawhub-skill-optimizer`
- When the main task is auditing upload risk; use `clawhub-security-auditor`
- When the main work is rewriting runtime behavior rather than packaging it

## Scope boundary

This skill owns:

- plugin or bundle directory structure
- manifest generation
- release layout and zip shape
- packaging validation
- runtime-only file trimming
- platform-aware breakout packaging rules

This skill does not own:

- primary search-copy optimization
- deep Suspicious/security auditing
- large runtime refactors beyond what packaging requires

## Packaging targets

Choose the artifact first:

- `runtime skill bundle`
  - for direct GitHub distribution or skill-layer publishing
  - keeps the skill directory itself as the primary artifact
- `ClawHub bundle plugin`
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` plus minimal `package.json`
  - best for pure skill collections
- `ClawHub code plugin`
  - `openclaw.plugin.json` plus `package.json`
  - use when config schema, native extensions, or code entrypoints are required
- `Claude marketplace plugin`
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and marketplace-compatible layout
- `Hermes runtime bundle`
  - runtime-only skill directory with Hermes-safe copy and structure
- `AgentSkill publish bundle`
  - runtime-only bundle optimized for quality/security review, platform labels, and GitHub trust proof

## Cross-market breakout packaging rules

### 1. Package for trust, not just parser correctness

Public users install plugins only when the package feels coherent:

- name, description, manifests, and README must describe the same thing
- side effects must be visible
- source repo and shipped files must agree
- only runtime files should ship

### 2. Package one sharp JTBD per artifact

Breakout plugins usually win because each artifact has a tight job:

- one system
- one operational surface
- one clear result

Do not ship a bloated "everything plugin" unless the flagship package is intentionally a command center with clear sibling plugins below it.

### 3. Package a flagship plus a sibling ladder

The best public creators rarely stop at one package. Prefer:

- flagship package
  - broad command center or broad plugin surface
- sibling packages
  - narrower high-intent actions or adjacent workflows

Packaging should make this family structure obvious rather than accidental.

### 4. Package proof and install clarity

Strong public packages usually include:

- coherent manifest fields
- runtime-only files
- README proof of what the package actually does
- trustworthy install/setup steps
- clear scope boundaries

## Platform-specific packaging heuristics

### ClawHub

- keep bundle vs code-plugin boundaries crisp
- make `runtimeId`, capabilities, and README match exactly
- prefer source-linked, coherent, scanner-friendly bundles
- if packaging a plugin, describe concrete side effects such as config writes, gateway restarts, or remote fetches

### Claude

- prefer clean repo-backed layouts and example-driven READMEs
- marketplace bundles should read clearly without relying on out-of-bundle files
- discovery improves when the package feels like one sharp workflow, not a dev dump

### Hermes

- optimize for category/tag clarity and runtime-only contents
- avoid noisy install or dev sections in the publish bundle

### AgentSkill

- quality score, security score, rating, GitHub stars, and platform coverage become part of the packaging surface
- package so reviewers can see discovery, implementation, structure, and expertise clearly
- if GitHub is the proof anchor, preserve the source linkage and README coherence

### GitHub

- package as a trustworthy source release, not a local workspace snapshot
- keep changelog/provenance/readme/install paths aligned

## Source skill hard conventions

Before packaging, validate that the source skill follows these conventions:

- published source skills should use `name`, `description`, and canonical `metadata.aisa`
- `metadata.aisa` should normally contain `emoji`, `requires`, `primaryEnv`, and `compatibility`
- command examples should use `{baseDir}` rather than bootstrap-only variables
- package only runtime-essential files by default: `SKILL.md`, runtime scripts, libraries, manifests, and minimal wrappers
- exclude compare, evaluate, test, sync, migration, and dev utilities unless the user explicitly asks for a developer bundle
- if the repo keeps a richer mother skill plus publish bundles, preserve the mother skill and trim only the publish bundles
- prefer repo-local config and data defaults over home-directory defaults when the packaged runtime persists files

## Packaging workflow

1. Analyze the source skill and the target platform.
2. Determine the artifact type.
3. Normalize the shipped file set.
4. Generate the correct manifests.
5. Preserve core skill semantics inside `skills/<skill-name>/`.
6. Validate the package layout and manifest fields.
7. Create a root-level release zip so required files sit directly at the zip root.

## Preserve core skill content

The content within `skills/<skill-name>/`, especially `SKILL.md`, should remain semantically intact during packaging. The packager may:

- remove non-runtime helpers from the release bundle
- trim caches, logs, and generated artifacts
- add platform manifests and wrapper files
- add packaging metadata that improves trust and publish clarity

The packager should not:

- silently rewrite the skill's core workflow
- introduce new auth paths
- broaden the runtime surface just to satisfy packaging convenience

## Real upload lessons

Recent real uploads were flagged for these reasons:

1. External CLI execution inside shipped helpers
2. Self-install or cache-sync behavior
3. Default writes into user-home data locations
4. Version-swapping or repo-mutation helpers
5. Shipping non-runtime test/compare/sync utilities
6. Aggressive data-retention wording
7. Browser cookie, Keychain, or local credential access helpers
8. Legacy secret inputs left in runtime config

Required packager behavior:

- bundle only runtime-essential files by default
- exclude helper scripts that invoke external CLIs or mutate local installs
- prefer repo-local persistence when persistence is required
- do not include `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, logs, debug artifacts, or non-text binaries in release zips
- exclude deprecated multi-provider auth paths from API-key-only bundles
- apply the same safety trimming to EN and ZH variants

## Plugin breakout lessons from live ClawHub plugin analysis

As of 2026-04-20, ClawHub plugin pages expose weak public install/download metrics, so public trust comes mostly from structure and coherence. Packaging should therefore emphasize:

- task-first or system-first titles
- explicit side effects and setup expectations
- strong verification surfaces such as source-linked provenance
- code-plugin clarity when real runtime behavior exists
- family logic that supports a flagship plugin plus narrower siblings

In other words: public packaging now needs to carry part of the growth strategy.

## Layout rules

### ClawHub bundle plugin

```text
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── package.json
├── skills/
│   └── skill-name/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── ...
└── README.md
```

### ClawHub code plugin

```text
plugin-name/
├── openclaw.plugin.json
├── package.json
├── skills/
│   └── skill-name/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── README.md
```

### Claude marketplace plugin

```text
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── package.json
├── skills/
│   └── skill-name/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── ...
└── README.md
```

## Zip rule

The release zip should place `package.json`, manifests, `skills/`, and other required root files directly at the root of the archive, not inside an extra `package/` folder.

## Validation

For local ClawHub-oriented plugin validation, use:

```bash
python3 /mnt/d/workplace/skillGet/.agents/skills/clawhub-plugin-packager/scripts/validate_plugin.py <path-to-plugin-dir>
```

## Example requests

- `Package this runtime skill as a ClawHub code plugin`
- `Wrap this release skill as a Claude marketplace plugin`
- `Trim this repo down to a publishable AgentSkill bundle and zip it correctly`
- `Generate the manifests for this plugin without changing the skill semantics`
